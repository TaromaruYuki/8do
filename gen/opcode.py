# Opcode rules:
# If opcode name has more than one addressing mode, add the first letter of the addressing mode to the opcode name.
# Else, use the full opcode.
# If a result is already taken or zero, add a space character at the end.
#
# Example:
# LDR - More than one. (LDRI, LDRA, LDRR)
# CLC - Only one. (CLC)
